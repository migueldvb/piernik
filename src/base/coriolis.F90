!! \brief Compute the Coriolis acceleration for a given row of cells.
!!
!! \details This is a low-order estimate of the Coriolis accelerations, because this routine uses density and velocity fields
!! from the beginning of the time step. This is a simple approach, but ignores any changes due to other accelerations during the time step.
!!
!! \todo add cylindrical geometry support (check carefully what exactly is u(iarr_all_my(:), :)/u(iarr_all_dn(:), :) and fogure out whether any geometrical factors are needed)
